# Particle (_formerly Spark_) iOS Cloud SDK
The Particle iOS Cloud SDK enables iOS apps to interact with Particle-powered connected products via the Particle Cloud.
Library will allow you to easily manage active user sessions to Particle cloud, query for device info,
read and write data to/from Spark Core/Photon devices and (via exposed variables and functions)
publish and subscribe events to/from the cloud or to/from devices (coming soon).

**Rebranding notice**

As you probably know Spark has been rebranded as Particle. 
Code currently refers to `SparkCloud` and `SparkDevice`, this will soon be replaced with `ParticleCloud` and `ParticleDevice`. A new Cocoapod library will be published and current one will point to the new one. 
This should not bother or affect your code for now.

**Beta notice**

This SDK is still under development and is currently released as Beta, although tested, bugs and issues may be present, some code might require cleanups. 

## Getting Started

- Perform the installation step described under the **[Installation](#installation)** section below for integrating in your own project
- You can also [Download Particle iOS Cloud SDK](https://github.com/spark/spark-sdk-ios/archive/master.zip) and try out the included iOS example app
- Be sure to check **Usage** before you begin for some code examples

## Usage

#### Logging in to Particle cloud
You don't need to worry about access tokens, SDK takes care of that for you

**Objective-C**
```objc
[[SparkCloud sharedInstance] loginWithUser:@"ido@particle.io" password:@"userpass" completion:^(NSError *error) {
    if (!error) 
        NSLog(@"Logged in to cloud");
    else 
        NSLog(@"Wrong credentials or no internet connectivity, please try again");
}];
```
**Swift**
```swift
SparkCloud.sharedInstance().loginWithUser("ido@particle.io", password: "userpass") { (error:NSError!) -> Void in
    if let e=error {
        println("Wrong credentials or no internet connectivity, please try again")
    }
    else {
        println("Logged in")
    }
}
```

#### Get a list of all devices
List the devices that belong to currently logged in user and find a specific device by name:

**Objective-C**

```objc
__block SparkDevice *myPhoton;
[[SparkCloud sharedInstance] getDevices:^(NSArray *sparkDevices, NSError *error) {
    NSLog(@"%@",sparkDevices.description); // print all devices claimed to user

    for (SparkDevice *device in sparkDevices)
    {
        if ([device.name isEqualToString:@"myNewPhotonName"])
            myPhoton = device;
    }
}];
```

**Swift**

```swift
var myPhoton : SparkDevice?
SparkCloud.sharedInstance().getDevices { (sparkDevices:[AnyObject]!, error:NSError!) -> Void in
    if let e = error {
        println("Check your internet connectivity")
    }
    else {
        if let devices = sparkDevices as? [SparkDevice] {
            for device in devices {
                if device.name == "myNewPhotonName" {
                    myPhoton = device
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```


#### Read a variable from a Particle device (Core/Photon)
Assuming here that `myPhoton` is an active instance of `SparkDevice` class which represents a device claimed to current user:

**Objective-C**
```objc
[myPhoton getVariable:@"temperature" completion:^(id result, NSError *error) {
    if (!error) {
        NSNumber *temperatureReading = (NSNumber *)result;
        NSLog(@"Room temperature is %f degrees",temperatureReading.floatValue);
    }
    else {
        NSLog(@"Failed reading temperature from Photon device");
    }
}];
```
**Swift**
```swift
myPhoton!.getVariable("temperature", completion: { (result:AnyObject!, error:NSError!) -> Void in
    if let e=error {
        println("Failed reading temperature from device")
    }
    else {
        if let temp = result as? Float {
            println("Room temperature is \(temp) degrees")
        }
    }
})
```

#### Call a function on a Particle device (Core/Photon)
Invoke a function on the device and pass a list of parameters to it, `resultCode` on the completion block will represent the returned result code of the function on the device

**Objective-C**
```objc
[myPhoton callFunction:@"digitalwrite" withArguments:@[@"D7",@1] completion:^(NSNumber *resultCode, NSError *error) {
    if (!error)
    {
        NSLog(@"LED on D7 successfully turned on");
    }
}];
```
**Swift**
```swift
let funcArgs = ["D7",1]
myPhoton!.callFunction("digitalwrite", withArguments: funcArgs) { (resultCode : NSNumber!, error : NSError!) -> Void in
    if (error == nil) {
        println("LED on D7 successfully turned on")
    }
}
```

#### List device exposed functions and variables
Functions is just a list of names, variables is a dictionary in which keys are variable names and values are variable types:

**Objective-C**
```objc
NSDictionary *myDeviceVariables = myPhoton.variables;
NSLog(@"MyDevice first Variable is called %@ and is from type %@", myDeviceVariables.allKeys[0], myDeviceVariables.allValues[0]);

NSArray *myDeviceFunctions = myPhoton.functions;
NSLog(@"MyDevice first Function is called %@", myDeviceFunctions[0]);
```
**Swift**
```swift
let myDeviceVariables : Dictionary? = myPhoton.variables as? Dictionary<String,String>
println("MyDevice first Variable is called \(myDeviceVariables!.keys.first) and is from type \(myDeviceVariables?.values.first)")

let myDeviceFunction = myPhoton.functions
println("MyDevice first function is called \(myDeviceFunction!.first)")
```

#### Get an instance of a device
Get a device instance by its ID:

**Objective-C**
```objc
__block SparkDevice *myOtherDevice;
NSString *deviceID = @"53fa73265066544b16208184";
[[SparkCloud sharedInstance] getDevice:deviceID completion:^(SparkDevice *device, NSError *error) {
    if (!error)
        myOtherDevice = device;
}];
```
**Swift**
```swift
var myOtherDevice : SparkDevice? = nil
    SparkCloud.sharedInstance().getDevice("53fa73265066544b16208184", completion: { (device:SparkDevice!, error:NSError!) -> Void in
        if let d = device {
            myOtherDevice = d
        }
    })
```

#### Rename a device
you can simply set the `.name` property or use -rename() method if you need a completion block to be called (for example updating a UI after renaming was done):

**Objective-C**
```objc
myPhoton.name = @"myNewDeviceName";
```

_or_
```objc
[myPhoton rename:@"myNewDeviecName" completion:^(NSError *error) {
    if (!error)
        NSLog(@"Device renamed successfully");
}];
```
**Swift**
```swift
myPhoton!.name = "myNewDeviceName"
```
_or_
```swift
myPhoton!.rename("myNewDeviceName", completion: { (error:NSError!) -> Void in
    if (error == nil) {
        println("Device successfully renamed")
    }
})
```

#### Logout 
Also clears user session and access token

**Objective-C**
```objc
[[SparkCloud sharedInstance] logout];
```
**Swift**
```swift
SparkCloud.sharedInstance().logout()
```

This should get you started. _Full usage documentation is coming soon._

Be sure to check out the [Reference in Cocoadocs website](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/Spark-SDK/) for full coverage of `SparkDevice` and `SparkCloud` usage. In addition you can consult the javadoc style comments in `SparkCloud.h` and `SparkDevice.h` for each public method.
If Particle iOS Cloud SDK is integrated in your XCode project you should be able to press `Esc` to get an auto-complete hints for each cloud and device method.

## Installation

Particle iOS Cloud SDK is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). Cocoapods is an easy to use dependacy manager for iOS.
You must have Cocoapods installed, if you don't then be sure to [Install Cocoapods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html) before you start:
To install the iOS Cloud SDK, simply add the following line to your Podfile on main project folder:

```ruby
pod "Spark-SDK"
```

and then run `pod update`. A new `.xcworkspace` file will be created for you to open by Cocoapods, open that file workspace file in XCode and you can start interacting with Particle cloud and devices by
adding `#import "Spark-SDK.h"`. (that is not required for swift projects)


#### Support for Swift projects
To use iOS Cloud SDK from within Swift based projects [read here](http://swiftalicio.us/2014/11/using-cocoapods-from-swift/), 
also be sure the check out [Apple documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/InteractingWithObjective-CAPIs.html) on this matter.
_Notice_ that we've included the required bridging header file in the SDK, you just need to copy it to your project add it as the active bridging header file in the project settings as described in the link above.
We also have an example app [here](https://github.com/spark/spark-setup-ios-example), this app also demonstrates the Particle DeviceSetup library usage
