<p>
This is a Fork of the official Spark-SDK. This code contains some fixes and improvements to the SDK code that helped created the demo app. The demo app now logs in to the cloud and get's devices. It can also poll variables and call functions. This is in no way intended to substitute the official release. Code still needs some cleanups to be ready for prime time. Feel free to contrinute.
<br><br>---original readme---<br>

Spark SDK is a library that will allow you to easily interact with internet connected hardware powered by Spark, that includes:
