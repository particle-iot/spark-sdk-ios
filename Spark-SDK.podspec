                        Particle (formerly Spark) iOS Cloud SDK Cocoapod library
                        The Particle iOS Cloud SDK enables iOS apps to interact with Particle-powered connected products via the Particle Cloud.
                        Library will enable your app to easily manage active user sessions to the Particle cloud, query for devices info,
                        read and write data to/from Spark Core/Photon and Electron devices and (via exposed firmware variables and functions)
                        publish and subscribe events to/from the cloud or to/from devices.
